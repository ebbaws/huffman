# huffman

This Visual Studio solution contains 6 different projects where I have put old code from a lab assignment in Data Compression that I worked on in 2012. It also contains another project, `huffman`, featuring recently-reworked versions of my old Huffman encoder and decoder. The idea was to improve on some clumsy solutions, make the code object-oriented, add a command-line interface, and above all to improve my C++ skills.
